    <p> Before you delve further you should know this site is under active construction. At the moment there's not much to see beyond this point. If you are on a Cyberdeck (mobile) know that this is nowhere near optimized for you at the moment. All contents are intended for viewing on a Navi (desktop) as of now.</p>

    <p>I encourage you to save this site and keep an eye out on it as it evolves into a higher form. In the mean time, you may see the digital genesis of my creation.</p>
